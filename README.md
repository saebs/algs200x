# Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization
Coursera / Edx Algorithmic Design and Techniques Course

# A personal project going through the problem sets using rust.

The Goal of this Project is for self learning the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization Course as instructed on Coursera/EDx together with Rust from first principles using only the Standard Libray and no Cargo. It also attempts to implement an automated grading tool (as an alternative to the course grader available for paid subscriptions).
Contributions from test coverage to developing the self grader are most welcome.

# Requirements 
Any Linux/ Unix like shell
GNU utilities pmap,awk,tail
Rust 1.45+


## Write the Programming Challenges 
Save your solution source files in "src" folder in Course folder.
You encouraged to use the rust standard library only. The objective is to learn from first principles.
leave crates.io for real world production projects.
Make use of the "stresser.rs" module to run stress tests in your solution.

## Building and Compiling Solution
Use the provided build tools or scripts as much as possible. 
We don't do cargo around here!!

1. To build only run this command in your shell. ./build.sh src/<solution>.rs

2. To build and run  " ./build_run.sh src/<solution>.rs  "


## 1. Running Grader 
$ ./grader.sh src/<solution>.rs
